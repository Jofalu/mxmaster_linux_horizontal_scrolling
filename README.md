# mxmaster_linux_horizontal_scrolling
Simple bash script to reverse horizontal scrolling of the MX Master mouse on Linux on some apps. 

Depends on xinput (xorg-xinput).

Run it and it will reverse the scrolling. Running it multiple times will not change anything.
Needs to be run again on restart or whenever the mouse is disconnected/reconnected.
